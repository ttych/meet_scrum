=== A Product

> A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary,
> known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could
> be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

=== Product Backlog & Product Goal

- *ordered* list of needed item to improve product.
- *emergent* list.
- the *single source* of work undertaken.

Product Goal:

- transparency
- long-term objective for the Scrum Team
- must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next

Refinement :

- breaking down items into smaller more precise
- ongoing activity
- add details: description, order, size
--

=== Sprint Backlog & Sprint Goal

- the Sprint Goal (the why)
- the selected Product Backlog items (the what)
- an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (the how)

[.notes]
--
- a plan by and for the Developers
- highly visible, real-time picture of the work

Sprint Goal:

- transparency
- creates coherence and focus
- encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate
  initiatives
- provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it
--

=== Increment & Definition of Done

> The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done,
> an Increment is born.

[.notes]
--
- a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal
- additive to all prior Increments (incremental)
- verified (all Increments work together)
- usable
- delivered to stakeholders
- meets the Definition of Done

Commitment : The Definition of Done
- transparency
- formal description of the state of the Increment
  when it meets the quality measures required for the product
